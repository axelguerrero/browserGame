<!-- introduction -->
This is Boxer Bounce, It's a 1v1 underwater platform fighter. My biggests insporations for this game were street fighter and platform fighters such as smash bros and multiversus, I also got inspiration from Bloxorz, a game from cool math when you get the rectangular prism into a hole. With out Chris Courses i would have struggled even more on this than i did

<!-- Bugs/incompletion -->
I wasnt able to get sprites into my game, I really struggled trying to do so and ended up leaving the blocks and just ended up adding more knock back value to make it more fun. 

The jump could go on for ever if youre on a platform.

Can still move after being killed and can still remove health
